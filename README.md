# ReversalLearning_OFC_S1

This folder contains the original Matlab codes used to produce the results for the  manuscript entitled 'Human orbitofrontal cortex signals decision outcomes to sensory cortex during flexible tactile learning' by Wang et al., 

The successful running of these codes needs some other toolbox, i.e., SPM (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/), RSA (https://github.com/rsagroup/rsatoolbox_matlab), gPPI (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/gppi).
